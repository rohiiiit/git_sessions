          I did not do it. I did not kill Joffery but I wish that I had! Watcing your visious basterd die
        gives me more releif than a thousand lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am!
        I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you I would gladly give my life to watch
        you all swollow it!!!
